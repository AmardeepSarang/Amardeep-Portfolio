Image processing – OCR
Summary: Created an optical character recognition (OCR) software that used K-nearest neighbors’ algorithm (k-nn) and 10000 handwritten digits from the MNIST digit dataset as training data.
Languages and libraries used: Python, OpenCV
Key skills and algorithms used: convolution filters, thinning algorithm, K-NN, other image processing techniques.
