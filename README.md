# Project Portfolio
Hi, I’m Amardeep Sarang, I recently completed a computer science master’s degree at the University of Waterloo. This repo serves as a curated space to showcase my older (pre-2020) past projects all in one place. Please click each individual project folder to see what it entails, or you can explore my newer projects in my other repos.
