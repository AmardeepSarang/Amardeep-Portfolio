Re “Subway Fare That Stinks: Nachos, Meat ... Crab Legs?” (news article, Oct. 25):

Andy Byford, the president of New York City Transit, has no idea what the New York commuter cares about.

The other day it took 30 minutes to travel one express stop on the E train in Queens from Forest Hills to Roosevelt Avenue. The conductor constantly announced that there were signal problems.

You quote Mr. Byford as saying, “A full-on subway meal or a roast chicken, leaving the bones all over the place, isn’t acceptable.” Frankly, I would not care if someone ate a turkey on the subway.

London trains run on time because the signal system was upgraded. All the resources of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority should be used to update the signal system so that the trains run in a timely fashion.

To the Editor:

My wife and I entered a crowded F train recently and immediately noticed a small stream of unidentified liquid, probably soda or an energy drink, starting 15 feet to the left of us, heading our way. A pair of tourists raised their feet to avoid it, as others did. I studied the stream, but could not determine if it was a soft drink or something more sinister.

At its source, on the floor, were the remnants of a meal. The diner was long gone, but apparently felt the need to leave his garbage for the enjoyment of others.

The answer: Ban food on the subway! In fact, ban food in the entire transit system! Then, perhaps, there would be fewer track fires and the resulting delays, too.
