La Maison du Chocolat, the Parisian confectioner, is setting up a hot-chocolate cart that will alternate its location: In front of its Upper East Side shop from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesdays through Sundays, until Dec. 16., and in front of the nearby Surrey hotel from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on those days. The cart will dispense the sweet, steaming drink — a dark chocolate blend called Caracas — for $8.50 per cup, with optional whipped cream.
