# Parallel programing - Julia sets
**Summary:** Developed a parallel program to generate a Julia set data points, then use the data points to generate a high resolution image. The program was run on the graham supercomputer.

**Languages and libraries used:** Message Passing Interface (MPI) using C, Python, Pillow (PIL)

**Key skills and algorithms used:** MPI programing, Parallel programing, load balancing, rendering large (100k x 100k) images
