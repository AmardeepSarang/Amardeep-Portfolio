# AI - N-queens problem
**Summary:** The n-queens problem is a problem where you try to place N queens on a NxN chess board such that no queen can attack another queen. In this project we attempted to solve the n-queens problem for large values of N using the min-conflict local search algorithm. We then visualized the solution. 

**Languages and libraries used:** Java, Python, OpenCV

**Key skills and algorithms used:** Min-Conflicts algorithm, Heavy focus on code optimization for large values of N.
